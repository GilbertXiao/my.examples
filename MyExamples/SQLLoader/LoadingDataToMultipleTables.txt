Notes:

REPLACE specifies that if there is data in the tables to be loaded (emp and proj), SQL*loader should delete the data before loading new rows. 
Multiple INTO TABLE clauses load two tables, emp and proj. The same set of records is processed three times, using different combinations of columns each time to load table proj. 
WHEN loads only rows with nonblank project numbers. When projno is defined as columns 25...27, rows are inserted into proj only if there is a value in those columns. 
When projno is defined as columns 29...31, rows are inserted into proj only if there is a value in those columns. 
When projno is defined as columns 33...35, rows are inserted into proj only if there is a value in those columns.

Running Case Study 5
Take the following steps to run the case study.

Start SQL*Plus as scott/tiger by entering the following at the system prompt: 
sqlplus scott/tiger


The SQL prompt is displayed.

At the SQL prompt, execute the SQL script for this case study, as follows: 
SQL> @ulcase5


This prepares and populates tables for the case study and then returns you to the system prompt.

At the system prompt, invoke SQL*Loader and run the case study, as follows: 
sqlldr USERID=scott/tiger CONTROL=ulcase5.ctl LOG=ulcase5.log


SQL*Loader loads the tables, creates the log file, and returns you to the system prompt. You can check the log file to see the results of running the case study.

Notes:

Errors are not encountered in the same order as the physical records due to buffering (array batch). The bad file and discard file contain records in the same order as they appear in the log file. 
Of the 12 logical records for input, three rows were rejected (rows for joker, young, and edds). No data was loaded for any of the rejected records. 
Of the 9 records that met the WHEN clause criteria, two (joker and young) were rejected due to data errors. 
Of the 10 records that met the WHEN clause criteria, three (joker, young, and edds) were rejected due to data errors.
